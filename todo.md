# TODO
This file contains a list in no order of notable elements needing to be done

## Implement multiple script usage.
There should be able to be 4 teams going at once. This can be done by shuffling the order that super searchers are visited. Each team is assigned a team number which will change their script. See team in the GameControl object.

## Citation questions
There is no implementation for the citation questions. It will most likely need additional in scene objects, but implementation should be quite similar to the others.
## End game
puzzleController needs to be done. Currently there is no functionality to give the answer final answer. Most importantly (partially because it hasn't been designed) there is no endgame.
